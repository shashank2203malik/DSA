You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
Return the merged string.


var mergeAlternately = function(word1, word2) {
    let mergedString = "";
    let minLength = Math.min(word1.length, word2.length);
    console.log(minLength);
    for(let i = 0; i < minLength; i++) {
        mergedString = mergedString + word1[i] + word2[i];
    }
    mergedString = mergedString + word1.substring(minLength, word1.length) + word2.substring(minLength , word2.length);
    console.log(mergedString);
    return mergedString;
};
