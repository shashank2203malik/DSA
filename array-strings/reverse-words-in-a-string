Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.



var reverseWords = function(s) {
    let resultArr = [];
    let arrString = s.split(' ');
    console.log(arrString);
    for(let i = arrString.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if(arrString[i] !== '') {
            resultArr.push(arrString[i]);
        console.log(resultArr);
    }
    }
    return resultArr.join(" ");
};
