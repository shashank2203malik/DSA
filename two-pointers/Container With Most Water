You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.

var maxArea = function(height) {
    let lo = 0;
    let hi = height.length - 1;
    let areaOfWater = 0;
    let max = 0;

    while(lo < hi) {
        areaOfWater = Math.min(height[lo], height[hi]) * (hi - lo);
        max = Math.max(areaOfWater, max);

        if(height[lo] > height[hi]) {
            hi--;
        }
        else {
